# Test
This repo is for testing how well you've learned about Opencv in python

Before you start, I need you to setup your environment first


## Step 1
  Get into your environment of Anaconda in the terminal
```terminal
   $source activate env_name
```

## Step 2
  Install Jupyter notebook in the environment
  <br>
  *You need to install the Jupyter notebook inside the env. Even if you already have one in the root env you'll need to install it again because only in this way can the jupyter notebook reach the packages you've install in the env*
```terminal
  $conda install jupyter notebook
```

## Step 3
  Fork this repo to your account and clone the repo to your local git
## Step 4
  cd to the dir of this repo in your computer and type the following code to start jupyter notebook
```terminal
  $jupyter notebook
```
## Step 5
 * Wait for the Jupyter notebook open a web page with a title name "Home"
 * Click the file "Test_opencv_1_to_6.ipynb" inside the web page. 
 * The file wil be opened in a new page. 
 * Click the block you wanted to start in the file
 * Each time you finish the code inside a block and click "Run|>" to get to the next block.
 * When you are done, save the file as .html file (Click "File"-->"Save as"-->".html")
 * Press ctrl+C in the terminal to terminate the jupyter notebook.
 * Push both your notebook and html file to your repository and inform Ben to check on your work.
  
  Wish You Luck!!
